# Wireless-Navigation-system
Visually impaired people face unique challenges navigating in unfamiliar public locations. Twenty â€“ five percent of the visually impaired people travel through public locations without assistance other than a walking stick. This paper is focused on developing an electronic navigation system for visually impaired people, which makes use of CC2500 for transcribing signals between the user and device. CC2500 is a wireless transceiver which is used for wireless communication. In our navigation system, the destination entered is converted to signals for emitting, so that the signal will be received by the device in the bus to identify the user requested bus number for destination place. Same method will be used for detecting the bus stop also. The real time signal is collected and the circuit board processes the signals. Based on the processed data, appropriate decision is taken by the microcontroller in it. The transceiver signal will be converted to audio output and will deliver the decision to the user via earphone or speaker.
